Recipe Search API application


The purpose of our app is to allow the user to send a search request to 
edamam API using a few ingredients as keywords.
The results list will give them various recipes that can be made using the 
key ingredients searched.

What makes us special?
Using the youtube video API, we will call up a relevant video for each recipe.
